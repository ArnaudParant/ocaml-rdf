<p>
The Sparql 1.1 query language is implemented, with some exceptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The following built-in calls are still missing:
  UUID, UCASE, LCASE,
  langMatches (only based on prefix by now, must implement
   language matching according to
   <ext-a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4647.txt">RFC 4647</ext-a>),
  TIMEZONE, TZ, SHA384, SHA512.
</li>
<li>Subqueries are not handled yet.</li>
<li>DESCRIBE queries are not handled yet.</li>
<li>Check of variable scope is not implemented yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The parsing of Turtle and Sparql queries is based on Ulex and Menhir.
But Ulex does not offer convenient way to handle positions. By now,
some hack allows to get the correct position for syntax errors,
but evaluation errors contains incorrect positions: line numbers
are correct, but character indices are offset from the beginning
of the file or string which was parsed.

<section id="todo" title="TODO">
<ul>
<li>A field "context" or "data" could be added to
triples in the graphs, as it is in <ext-a href="http://librdf.org/">Redland RDF libraries</ext-a>.
</li>
<li>Implement <ext-a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/">Sparql 1.1 Update</ext-a>.</li>
